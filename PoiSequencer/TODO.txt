TODO:

- Allow better features in the edit view:
  - Resize image (using drag)
  - Fill tool
  - Line tool (optional antialiassing)
  - Select and cut/copy/paste/move
- Make better image duration dialog
- Save project to open later without exporting
- Add export timeline button (single or multiple files? Will need different arduino codes to cope)
- Drag and drop images around the timeline
  - Or at least swap with adjacent images
