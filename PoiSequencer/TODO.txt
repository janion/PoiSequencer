TODO:

- Allow better features in the edit view:
  - Resize image (using drag)
  - Fill tool
  - Line tool (optional antialiassing)
  - Select and cut/copy/paste/move
- Make better image duration dialog
- Decide if timeline export should be single or multiple files? Will need different arduino codes to cope
  - Currently single file
- Drag and drop images around the timeline
  - Or at least swap with adjacent images
- Add text as well as images (Will require additional arduino code)
- Loading and saving should be done on separate threads?
- Loaded image node should notify observers of save requested instead of doing the saving itself
  - Home view should not be doing so much processing
  - Convert all models to use URIs not URLs


DONE:

+ Right click on loaded image to save
+ Add image to Loaded view on tick from new image dialog
+ Double click on loaded image to edit
+ Load in images
+ Compress loaded images in both size and colour palette
+ Right click on loaded image to add to timeline (Via model)
+ Right click on timeline image to remove
+ Right click on timeline image to change duration
+ Add time scale to timeline
+ Time scale on timeline should be numbered
+ Timeline set ticks to "logical" values eg. 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, etc.
+ Min and max zoom levels
+ Convert LoadedImageView to use a LoadedImageModel
+ Ensured separation of image used in loaded and timeline views
+ Save project to open later without exporting
  + Make zip file containing:
    * .csv holding order of loaded files (file name, saved file name)
    * .csv holding order and duration of images (file name, saved file name, duration)
    * .bmp files for all loaded and timeline images
+ Add loaded project model to home view
+ Export timeline menu item (single or multiple files? Will need different arduino codes to cope)
+ Model for drawing image
+ Controls for what draw tool is being used
+ Coordinate display for drawing view
